### A Bit About Me
<img src="gonzo.png" alt="Gonzo Bonzo" width="250px" align="right" />

I am a recent graduate from the University of Waterloo (class of 2020) where I completed a Bachelor's degree in Systems Design Engineering. I love sports, particularily [volleyball](https://athletics.uwaterloo.ca/sports/mens-volleyball/roster/jonathan-loos/6979), and my dog's name is Gonzo -->

## ü´Ç A note on mental health
Recognition that mental health affects us all in different ways is critical for us to connect and support our community. Encouragement is sent to anyone who feels like they are struggling or have a friend who is struggling to reach out, seek help and support others whenever possible.

> Take a look at [Cove](https://github.com/jonathanloos/cove), a previous project looking to digitize Suicide Safety Plans for reliable, consistent access wherever you are and whenever you need it.

## üôè Who I work best with
This is always a tough question to answer because relationships can grow over time, sometimes contradicting it in the long run. It's up there with "tell me a bit about yourself" in an interview where you proceed to forget who you are... To put it simply, I work best with open minded individuals who are passionate about the initiative we're working on. I prioritize interpersonal relationships over skillset when I'm deciding if I'll work well with someone.

## ‚òïÔ∏è What motivates me
I am very much fueled by the team and environment that I'm currently in. For example, while still able to work well independently, remote work killed my motivation because I wasn't in the office with the team. However, using tools like [Gather](https://harled.ca/blog/gather_for_hybrid_teams) really helped me find fun and energy in my work until we could get back into the office. There's just something about having a bunch of like minded people grinding work all around me that keeps me going.

## ‚õΩÔ∏è How I lead
I like to pump tires for those who deserve it. Recognition is an amazing tool that I feel is severely underutilized because of factors like pride and humility. Gassing up a teammate while avoiding overexaggeration keeps my team going, so I will make sure it happens. Giving the team the motivation to continue is all the leading I need to to most of the time, the rest takes care of itself.

## üí≠ How I follow
I'm not afraid to give feedback and have healthy discussions with whoever it is I'm learning from. I work best when there's a mutual understanding between me and my superior that I will respect their opinions and suggestions so long as I feel a mutual respect in return. I love to talk it out, and struggle if the receiving party isn't responsive to suggestion or change.
