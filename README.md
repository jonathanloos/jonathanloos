### Hey 👋 I'm Jon

I am a problem solver disguised as a software engineer, kind of like spiderman 🕷  but you know... not. I love dogs with a slight bias towards Labs, Weims and Dobies (Gonzo wouldn't appreciate being left out of this..). I grew up with Track and Field and Soccer being tightly coupled with my life until parting ways to focus on volleyball in university.
